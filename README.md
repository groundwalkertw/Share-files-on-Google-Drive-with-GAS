# Share-files-on-Google-Drive-with-GAS
<p>This little project of mine is to add users/viewers to files hosted on Google Drive, with Google Apps Script (GAS) and some Google Services. This is to give permission of access to restricted files, while minimizing the chore of the owner, so that he/she doesn't have to add the viewers one by one.</p>

<p>There are three parts of this project:
<ol>
<li>tweight: Add all users listed in a sheet as viewers.</li>
<li>Good-enough: Like above, but now we can choose which files/folders to share with individual users.</li>
<li>Do-it-all: Let the user fill in a form, and automatically add him/her as a viewer.</li>
</ol>
</p>
